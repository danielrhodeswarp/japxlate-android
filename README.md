# japxlate-android
This is the Japxlate Android app

It's an offline searchable English <--> Japanese dictionary with a few other novelties.

This app is what we build step-by-step in the PhoneGap by Dissection tutorial (as at https://leanpub.com/phonegapbydissection )

NOTE
debuggable is set to true in AndroidManifest.xml

TODO
- prob remove the NetBeans cruft
- check if it drops into others' Eclipse IDE cleanly
- .cordova folder?
